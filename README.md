You are required to compute a temperature distribution for a rectangular 2D problem with
boundary conditions set at top 20°C, bottom 100°C, left 10°C and right 140°C with a range of
problem sizes. To do this you are required to modify the codes to:
• reflect the boundary conditions described above
• report the execution time Record the run-time of your code under a range of problem sizes
using different levels of compiler optimization.

Please refer to the report for a more detailed analysis on this matter.
